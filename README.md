# Chainlink-Random-Number

Basic chainlink oracle for generating a random number to be implemented in dApps 
or whenever a random number is needed.

This is set up for Kovan network, however by changing addresses you can easily 
deploy on other networks that Chainlink is on.

Finally, this will require 0.1 LINK for every time that random number is being 
requested and returned and you must have LINK in your contract, else it won't work.

Once your contract is deployed, send LINK from your wallet to the contract address.
